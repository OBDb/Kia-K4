    description: "The original Kia K4 was a mid-size sedan developed specifically for the Chinese market, positioned between the K3 (Forte/Cerato) and K5 (Optima) in Kia's lineup. Featuring styling that aligned with Kia's global design language of the time, including the brand's signature 'tiger nose' grille, it offered a spacious interior that catered to Chinese consumers' preference for rear passenger comfort. Powertrain options included 1.8L and 2.0L naturally aspirated four-cylinder engines paired with either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. The interior offered a blend of technology and comfort features targeting young professional buyers, including available features like a touchscreen infotainment system, dual-zone climate control, and premium audio. Despite its market-specific development, the first-generation K4 achieved only modest sales success in the competitive Chinese sedan market and was discontinued after a relatively short production run."

    description: "The new Kia K4 has been reimagined as a global model, launching first in North America with a distinctive 'fastback sedan' design that combines a sedan roofline with an integrated hatchback openingâ€”similar in concept to the Stinger but in a smaller package. Based on a new platform, it features bold styling with angular headlights, an evolved 'tiger face' front end, and a coupe-like silhouette with strong character lines. The exterior incorporates distinctive elements including the star map LED lighting signatures, flush door handles, and an integrated rear spoiler. Measuring 4,705mm in length with a 2,750mm wheelbase, it positions between traditional compact and mid-size segments. Powertrain options for the North American market include a standard 2.0L naturally aspirated four-cylinder producing 147 HP and a turbocharged 1.6L four-cylinder delivering 190 HP in higher trims, both paired with a CVT transmission. The interior features a driver-focused design with a standard panoramic display combining a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen under a single piece of glass, plus an available 5.0-inch climate control screen. Advanced technology includes available Digital Key 2.0, Over-the-Air updates, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and a comprehensive suite of driver assistance systems. The K4's practical hatchback design offers generous cargo capacity with folding rear seats, despite its sedan appearance. As a replacement for the Forte sedan in some markets, the K4 represents Kia's strategy of offering distinctive designs that break traditional segment boundaries while providing the value and technology that have become hallmarks of the brand."
